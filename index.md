## Welcome to my website demo!

Let me tell you about my Creative project number 1 ! 

In this Creative Priject Number 1 I decided to work with two short fantasy & Science Fiction novelettes by Ted Chiang Tower of Babylon & The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate they are both a part of the short stories collections Exhalation: Stories.

The Merchant and the Alechemist's Gate:Tells the story of a merchant who meets a shop owner who invites Fuwaad into the back workshop to see a mysterious black stone arch which serves as a gateway into the future, which the shop owner has made by the use of alchemy. Fuwaad is intrigued, and the shop owner tells him three stories of others who have traveled through the gate to meet and have conversation with their future selves. When Fuwaad learns that the shop keeper has another gate in Cairo that will allow people to travel into the past, he makes the journey there to try to rectify a mistake he made twenty years earlier

Tower of Babylon: Tells the story of Hillalum. A miner from Elam who has been summoned to the Tower of Babylon, an enormous brick tower that has been in continuous construction for centuries. He and his colleagues have been hired to dig through the Vault of Heaven to discover Yahweh's creation. Hillalum alone passes safely through the Vault. After a perilous journey ever-upwards, he finds that he has reemerged back at the surface, some distance from the Tower, rather than in Heaven as expected.
